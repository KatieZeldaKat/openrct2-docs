==============

When you open a new game (or load a saved game), you will be presented with the following interface:

The above screenshot contains four parts:

1. The **top toolbar**. This has options for pausing, loading and saving your game; modifying views; adding new things to your park and managing it.
2. The **bottom toolbar**. This consists of the two green blocks in either bottom corner, as well as the news bar, which will appear between them if a news message arrives.
3. The **park window**. This window will open automatically if you start a new game. The window shows some statistics, allows changing the admission price and shows your objective.
4. The **viewport**. This consists of everything not covered by a toolbar or a window and provides a view on your actual park.

The top toolbar is divided into four groups.

The first group consists of:

1. The **pause button**. Click it to pause the game. Click it again to unpause. When your game is paused, you won't be able to build.
2. The **fast forward button**. This speeds up the time (up to 8Ã—). This can be useful if you need to wait for an event to happen (like earning money or invention of a ride).
3. The **disk options button**. This allows you to start a new game, load or save, take a screenshot, modify options or quit the game.

The second group consists of view options:

1. The **zoom out button**. This allows you to get a better view of your park, at the cost of some detail.

3. The **rotate view button**. The will rotate the view by 90 degrees.
4. The **view options button**. Allows you to hide elements from the map and look underground.
5. The **map button**. Will open the Map window, which shows an overview of your park.

The third group consists of build options:

6. The **new rides button**. Opens up a window that allows you to build new rides in your park.

The fourth group consists of management options:

2. The **research and development button**. This gives you access to research and development settings, including funding, priorities, and checking status of the current invention.
3. The **rides list button**. Shows a list of rides, shops and stalls, and facilities.
4. The **park window button**. This opens up the park window (note that it is already open in the screenshot at the top of this page).
5. The :ref:`staff button <staff>`. Allows you to hire and sack staff, check their status and assign them to specific areas.
6. The **guest list button**. This shows all your guests. You can use this to see what your guests want or need to improve their visit (and thus increase your park rating).
