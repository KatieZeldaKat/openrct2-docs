Installing OpenRCT2 on Windows
==============================
In order to play OpenRCT2, you need a copy of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. Whilst it is possible to play OpenRCT2 without music, sound and the official scenarios, tracks and objectsâ€¦ the base graphics are still required (known as g1.dat). OpenRCT2 will work with any version and region of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 including the original CD game, the GOG edition and the Steam edition. If you have installed the game in the default location, OpenRCT2 should automatically detect it and read the required files directly. If however you have not installed the game in the default location, you will be required to locate them when you start OpenRCT2 for the first time. You must select the directory containing the subdirectories ``Data``, ``ObjData``, ``Scenarios`` and ``Tracks``.
